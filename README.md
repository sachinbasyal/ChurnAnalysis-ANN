# Telco Customer Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (TensorFlow/Keras)
This project successfully demonstrates the end-to-end development of a customer churn prediction system using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
* Initiated the project with churn-rate EDA, uncovering key indicators such as tenure, monthly charges, and total charges distributions by churn status.
* Executed robust data preprocessing using ColumnTransformer with binary encoding, MinMaxScaler, and OneHotEncoder to prepare clean, model-ready inputs.
* Developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras ANN, featuring hidden layers and dropout to mitigate overfitting, trained on an 80/20 stratified split.
* Achieved 80% accuracy, with high recall for retained customers and fair performance on churn detection, backed by classification metrics.
* Delivered a deployable solution capable of predicting customer churn risk, offering direct value for customer retention strategies in telecom CRM systems.
